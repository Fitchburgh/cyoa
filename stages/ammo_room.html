    <h1>As I entered the ammo room...</h1>
    <p>My gut wrenched in pain, still reeling from the experience in the gunroom.
    I could hear something below me.  Which turned the adrenaline on.  With
    my heightened senses, I peered out the tiny hole they called a window on
    these old ships and swore I saw a fin swimming down below the hull.

    Above me another blasted hole which opened into a dark room, however my
    headlight happened upon a glimmer which looked like gold. Could this be the
    Coil I sought?! </p>
