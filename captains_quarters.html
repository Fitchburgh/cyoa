    <h1>The Captain's Quarters...</h1>
    <p>appeared to be of decent size.  The amount of treasure in this room
      was astounding. After searching for a few minutes
      I could see this could be worth a small fortune.  But not the treasure I
      sought.
      A small door was behind what was left of the bed frame, and a very dark
      hole in corner of the room, just large enough to fit through.  I had to
      press on to find the coil!</p>
