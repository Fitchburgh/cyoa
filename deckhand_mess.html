    <h1>As I swam up the shaft...</h1>
    <p>the air in my tank showed nearly full.  I listened intently for any
      sounds that would indicate a shark was near.  Once I presumed the coast
      was clear, I swam further up.  I entered a large space, probably the
      deckhands mess.  To the left the kitchen.</p>
