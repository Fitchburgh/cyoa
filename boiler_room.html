    <title>Coil - Boiler Room</title>

  <body>
    <h1>It was almost as if...</h1>
    <p> the heat from the boilers were still blaring.  I got a sense at how hot
       this room could actually get.  Outside I heard pounding on the hull.
       Something was out there.  Below me the darkness swelled, but it seemed
       to be an option.</p>
       <p> Under one of the boiler tanks I could see a red button.  Strange...
         behind the boiler a cutout on the floor.  If I just stand on that and
         press the button...</p>

    <button class="shark-death btn btn-primary">Swim Down</button>
    <button class="secret-btn-1 btn btn-primary">Press the button??</button>
