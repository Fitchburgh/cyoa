    <h1> I entered the ship from a hole in its hull (lol)... </h1>
    <p>You search around this room, which appeared to hold some chests, just
      eroded clothing left now.  Nothing of consequence.  You see above you a
      large hole that led to a large open room.  To the right an area for more
      storage. Could the adventure be over this soon? </p>
